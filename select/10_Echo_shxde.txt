Take the sun from the sky
Steal the moon from the night
I will never let go
For your love

I would climb any mountain
Stand at the top shout it out
You'll hear my love coming down
For your love

Oh oh oh oh
From the sky
From the from the night
Oh oh oh oh
Never let go let go let go
For your love

Oh oh oh oh
From the sky
From the from the night
Oh oh oh oh
Never let go let go let go
For your love

For your love

(You're my echo)
(You're my echo)

Like an echo
You're my echo
All my love it will flow
You're my echo

Like an echo
You're my echo
All my love it will flow
You're my echo

Like an echo
You're my echo
All my love it will flow
You're my echo

Oh oh oh oh
From the sky
From the from the night
Oh oh oh oh
Never let go let go let go
(Oh oh oh oh)
For your love

I would climb any mountain
Stand at the top shout it out
You'll hear my love coming down
For your love
