[00:43.23] You swore you'd never be them
[00:49.80] You're just like them
[00:53.92] You're just like them now
[00:58.03] All the times you said you hate them
[01:04.84] Just to hurt them
[01:09.04] You're just like them
[01:28.21] You're just like them now
[01:57.26] Such a cold place that you live in
[02:19.19] When you blame them
[02:22.47] You're just like them
[02:26.59] Still the stars shine down on your skin
[02:31.07] Do you see them?
[02:36.95] You're just like them now
