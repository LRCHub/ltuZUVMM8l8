Are you walking again?
Can I hold your hand?
I will sit with you

We can fly
We can dream
We can't have that ecstasy
Why don't give me his echo location
Echo location
Echo location

This is his song
This is his life
This is [?] we're not fine
This is a pass of gentle beach
Here is a tissue, here is a tissue
Why don't give me his echo location
Echo location

Close your eyes, girl
Close your eyes, girl
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close you eyes
